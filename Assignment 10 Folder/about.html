                Fakelandia's Local Aquarium started 5 years ago seeking to be the <strong>best</strong> source of local information in regards to local marine flora and fauna. We make sure to contact global and in-house experts in the field to ensure that our residents have the <strong>best quality</strong> habitats.
                <br>
                In addition to spreading accurate information to young and old visitors, we also do our own fair share of Research and Discovery (R&D) by running and funding our own projects with <em>your</em> contributions. Any discoveries we make are made sure to be appropriately disclosed to the scientific community.
                <br>
                Our contributions to the community do not end there, however, with our own conservation teams, run solely by active and passionate volunteers make significant strides to a better world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We make sure to maintain proper safety and health guidelines for our workers, researchers, and visitors in accordance to local regulation, similar to that of the <a href = 'https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2332/safety-example-practices-for-aquariums-zoos-2015-.pdf'>AZA</a>.
