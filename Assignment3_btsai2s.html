            Welcome to the official website of <strong>Fakelandia's Local Aquarium</strong>! We strive for the <em>utmost</em> quality of habitats for our creatures and for spreading accurate, up-to-date, and fascinating information on our aquatic neighbors. In addition, we do our fair share on finding new information by enabling marine biologists and students to better understand our local ecosystem.
