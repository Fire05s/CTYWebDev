        <!--
            The goal for the design of the website homepage is a fluid but sleek interface that is modern but
            also easy to navigate. Because this website will act as a central hub for employees, volunteers,
            and visitors, colors and features should be effective and simple, conveying their point easily.
            Blue, black, white, and other variations of these colors will likely fit well for an aquarium
            website. The website will use the Sans Serif font family for best readability and adherence to
            the useful purpose of the website. Titles and other elements of similar importance, should be
            unique with their designs so as to be visually appealing to the website visitor. For example, with
            the title on the homepage, I attempted to make it look like a tank with the words being a gold
            fish. Other fun designs could make the website not only more interesting but also more memorable.
